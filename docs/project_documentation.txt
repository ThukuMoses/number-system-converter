INTRODUCTION
Number systems are a technique to represent numbers in the computer system architecture, every value that you are saving or getting into or from computer memory has a defined number system. The number system is used in the computer system for better communication and representation. We type letters or words into a computer system but computers do not understand words and letters; therefore, it converts every letter and word into numbers for better understanding and processing.
The digital computer converts or translates all data and information like audio, video, graphics, and text into binary form, i.e., 0s and 1s, which is easily read and understood by computers for better functionality and proper outputs. The output generated by computers is in human-readable form.
The different number systems are all equally important in a computer system for each of the number systems have their own functions. This is therefore why number system conversion is important. Moving between these number systems is very common, but doing it manually is slow and can lead to mistakes. 
This project aims to make the process easier by creating a mobile application that can automatically convert numbers from one system to another. The app works on both Android and iOS devices and gives users a simple way to type in a number in one system and instantly see the result in the system they want all this aiming to provide fast, accurate and reliable results
Apart from solving a practical problem, the project also helps the team put what we learnt in class into practice giving us a chance to experience how real software is built. Working as a group also teaches us teamwork, problem solving, and the use of project management methods.
Therefore, this project is not only about converting numbers but also preparing ourselves with the skills needed in future technology work.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
The main problem in application of the number systems in the computer system is moving between these systems. Manual conversion requires several steps and can be confusing, especially when dealing with large values or fractional numbers making mistakes to be more common and the process slow, making it unsuitable for real-world applications where speed and accuracy are important.
There is a need for a simple, accessible, and cross-platform solution that can automatically and accurately convert numbers between different bases since the ones that are being used commonly nowadays are either not reliable, user-friendly or available online for example calculators or online tools.

OBJECTIVES
The objective of this project is to design and implement a mobile application that automates number system conversions between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal providing fast, accurate, and user-friendly results on both android and iOS devices by: - 
1.	Analyzing the requirements for number system conversions and identifying the common numeral bases to be supported.
2.	Designing algorithms that can handle both integer and fractional number conversions across different bases.
3.	Developing a mobile application that works on both android and iOS 
4.	Implementing a user interface that allows users to easily input numbers, select bases, and view results.
5.	Integrating input validations and error handling to prevent incorrect conversions and improve reliability.
6.	Testing the application thoroughly to make sure it is accurate and performs well.
7.	Documenting the development process and program details for academic and practical purposes
8.	Deploying the final application on android and iOS platforms for accessibility and use by learners and professionals

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED 

1.	Programming Language & Framework
Python
Kivy
2. Development Environment
Visual studio code
3. Version Control & Collaboration
Git – for version control and tracking changes in source code.
GitHub – for hosting the repository, team collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.
4. Testing & Debugging Tools
Kivy Built-in Debugger/Logger
Python Unit Testing
5. Project Management & Documentation
•	GitHub Projects / Issues – task tracking and agile workflow.
•	Google Docs / MS Word – writing process and program documentation.
•	Edraw – creating flowcharts, data flow diagrams (DFDs), and system models.
•	Figma/Canva – for designing simple UI mockups.
6. Build & Deployment Tools
Buildozer- Bundles the kivy app into an android APK file that can be installed on the mobile devices
